`nb-clean` cleans Jupyter notebooks of cell execution counts, metadata, outputs,
and (optionally) empty cells, preparing them for committing to version control.
It provides both a Git filter and pre-commit hook to automatically clean
notebooks before they're staged, and can also be used with other version control
systems, as a command line tool, and as a Python library. It can determine if a
notebook is clean or not, which can be used as a check in your continuous
integration pipelines.

:warning: _`nb-clean` 2.0.0 introduced a new command line interface to make
cleaning notebooks in place easier. If you upgrade from a previous release,
you'll need to migrate to the new interface as described under
[Migrating to `nb-clean` 2](#migrating-to-nb-clean-2)._

## Installation

To install the latest release from [PyPI], use [pip]:

```bash
python3 -m pip install nb-clean
```

`nb-clean` can also be installed with [Conda]:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nb-clean
```

In Python projects using [Poetry] or [PDM] for dependency management, add
`nb-clean` as a development dependency with `poetry add --group dev nb-clean` or
`pdm add --dev nb-clean`. `nb-clean` requires Python 3.8 or later.

## Usage

### Checking

You can check if a notebook is clean with:

```bash
nb-clean check notebook.ipynb
```

or by passing the notebook contents on standard input:

```bash
nb-clean check < notebook.ipynb
```

To also check for empty cells, add the `-e`/`--remove-empty-cells` flag. To
ignore cell metadata, add the `-m`/`--preserve-cell-metadata` flag, optionally
with a selection of metadata fields to ignore. To ignore cell outputs, add the
`-o`/`--preserve-cell-outputs` flag.

`nb-clean` will exit with status code 0 if the notebook is clean, and status
code 1 if it is not. `nb-clean` will also print details of cell execution
counts, metadata, outputs, and empty cells it finds.

### Cleaning (interactive)

You can clean a Jupyter notebook with:

```bash
nb-clean clean notebook.ipynb
```

This cleans the notebook in place. You can also pass the notebook content on
standard input, in which case the cleaned notebook is written to standard
output:

```bash
nb-clean clean < original.ipynb > cleaned.ipynb
```

To also remove empty cells, add the `-e`/`--remove-empty-cells` flag. To
preserve cell metadata, add the `-m`/`--preserve-cell-metadata` flag, optionally
with a selection of metadata fields to preserve. To preserve cell outputs, add
the `-o`/`--preserve-cell-outputs` flag.

### Cleaning (Git filter)

To add a filter to an existing Git repository to automatically clean notebooks
when they're staged, run the following from the working tree:

```bash
nb-clean add-filter
```

This will configure a filter to remove cell execution counts, metadata, and
outputs. To also remove empty cells, use:

```bash
nb-clean add-filter --remove-empty-cells
```

To preserve cell metadata, such as that required by tools such as [papermill],
use:

```bash
nb-clean add-filter --preserve-cell-metadata
```

To preserve only specific cell metadata, e.g., `tags` and `special`, use:

```bash
nb-clean add-filter --preserve-cell-metadata tags special
```

To preserve cell outputs, use:

```bash
nb-clean add-filter --preserve-cell-outputs
```

`nb-clean` will configure a filter in the Git repository in which it is run, and
won't mutate your global or system Git configuration. To remove the filter, run:

```bash
nb-clean remove-filter
```

### Cleaning (pre-commit hook)

`nb-clean` can also be used as a [pre-commit] hook. You may prefer this to the
Git filter if your project already uses the pre-commit framework.

Note that the Git filter and pre-commit hook work differently, with different
effects on your working directory. The pre-commit hook operates on the notebook
on disk, cleaning the copy in your working directory. The Git filter cleans
notebooks as they are added to the index, leaving the copy in your working
directory dirty. This means cell outputs are still visible to you in your local
Jupyter instance when using the Git filter, but not when using the pre-commit
hook.

After installing [pre-commit], add the `nb-clean` hook by adding the following
snippet to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/srstevenson/nb-clean
    rev: 3.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: nb-clean
```

You can pass additional arguments to `nb-clean` with an `args` array. The
following example shows how to preserve only two specific metadata fields. Note
that, in the example, the final item `--` in the arg list is mandatory. The
option `--preserve-cell-metadata` may take an arbitrary number of field
arguments, and the `--` argument is needed to separate them from notebook
filenames, which `pre-commit` will append to the list of arguments.

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/srstevenson/nb-clean
    rev: 3.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: nb-clean
        args:
          - --remove-empty-cells
          - --preserve-cell-metadata
          - tags
          - slideshow
          - --
```

Run `pre-commit install` to ensure the hook is installed, and
`pre-commit autoupdate` to update the hook to the latest release of `nb-clean`.

### Preserving all nbformat metadata

To ignore or preserve specifically the metadata defined in the
[`nbformat` documentation](https://nbformat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#cell-metadata),
use the following options:
`--preserve-cell-metadata collapsed scrolled deletable editable format name tags jupyter execution`.

### Migrating to `nb-clean` 2

The following table maps from the command line interface of `nb-clean` 1.6.0 to
that of `nb-clean` >=2.0.0.
