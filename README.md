# nb-clean

`nb-clean` cleans Jupyter notebooks of cell execution counts, metadata, outputs,
and (optionally) empty cells, preparing them for committing to version control.
It provides a Git filter to automatically clean notebooks before they are
staged, and can also be used as a standalone tool outside Git or with other
version control systems. It can determine if a notebook is clean or not, which
can be used as a check in your continuous integration pipelines.

## Installation

To install the latest release from [PyPI], use [pip]:

```bash
python -m pip install nb-clean
```

Alternately, in Python projects using [Poetry] or [Pipenv] for dependency
management, add `nb-clean` as a development dependency with
`poetry add --dev nb-clean` or `pipenv install --dev nb-clean`. `nb-clean`
requires Python 3.6 or later.

## Usage

### Cleaning

To install a filter in an existing Git repository to automatically clean
notebooks before they are staged, run the following from the working tree:

```bash
nb-clean configure-git
```

This will configure a filter to remove cell execution counts, metadata, and
outputs. To also remove empty cells, use:

```bash
nb-clean configure-git --remove-empty
```

`nb-clean` will configure a filter in the Git repository in which it is run, and
will not mutate your global or system Git configuration. To remove the filter,
run:

```bash
nb-clean unconfigure-git
```

Aside from usage from a filter in a Git repository, you can also clean up a
Jupyter notebook manually with:

```bash
nb-clean clean -i original.ipynb -o cleaned.ipynb
```

or by passing the notebook contents on stdin:

```bash
nb-clean clean < original.ipynb > cleaned.ipynb
```

To also remove empty cells, add the `--remove--empty` flag.

### Checking

You can check if a notebook is clean with:

```bash
nb-clean check -i notebook.ipynb
```

or by passing the notebook contents on stdin:

```bash
nb-clean check < notebook.ipynb
```

To also check for empty cells, add the `--remove--empty` flag.

`nb-clean` will exit with status code 0 if the notebook is clean, and status
code 1 if it is not. `nb-clean` will also print details of cell execution
counts, metadata, outputs, and empty cells it finds.
